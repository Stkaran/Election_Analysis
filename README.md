# Election_Analysis

## Purpose 
We were tasked with reviewing data from a recent election in Colorado and reporting on the major takeaways from it. They included:
  1. The total number of votes
  2. The list of candidates
  3. The number of votes each cadidate received
  4. The percentage of the vote for each candidate
  5. The winner based on popular vote

## Tools Used
  python version 3.7.6, election_results.csv

To find all of these answers, we used code that allowed us to navigate to and read our csv file, for loops to find candidate names and count votes associated with that name, and finally a conditional that allowed us to determine the winner of the election.

## Results
  We found there was a total of 369,711 votes cast in this election. There were three candidates: Charkes Stockham, Diana Degette, and Raymon Doane. 
    
    Charles Stockham received 85,213 votes which was around 23% of all votes cast.
    Diana Degette received 272,892 votes which was around 74% of all votes cast.
    Raymond Doane received 11,606 votes which was around 3.1% of all votes cast.
  
  As you can see, Diana Degette was ultimately declared the winner of the election 
  
## Challenges 
  As this was our first project with Python, the most difficult part was learing the new syntax along with utilizing the new addition of dictiionaries properly. There is still much more that could be done with this data, such as looking at voter turnout per county and if a county skewed more towards a specific candidate.
